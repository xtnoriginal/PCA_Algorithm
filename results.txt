1. What are the Eigenvalues for the principal components 1 and 2? :
154.311
9.16296
2. What are the Eigenvectors for the principal components 1 and 2 (showing
July and January component values for each)? :
 0.939141 -0.343532
 0.343532  0.939141
3. Compute the values for the covariance matrix : 
137.181 46.8283
46.8283 26.2925
4. What is the total variance? :
163.474
5. What proportion (as a percentage) of total variance do principal components 1  :
94.3948%
 What proportion (as a percentage) of total variance do principal components 2  :
5.60516%
The results show that principal 1(january) explains 94.3948% of the variability meaning january data is more variable while Principal 2(june) explains  5.60516% of the variability meaning more variable
